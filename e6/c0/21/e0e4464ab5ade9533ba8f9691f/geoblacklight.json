Ruffed Grouse Management Areas (RGMA) are managed to provide forest age-class diversity to provide excellent habitat for ruffed grouse, woodcock, and other early-successional wildlife species. These areas may or may not contain trails maintained to facilitate hunting. Off-highway vehicles generally are not allowed on RGMAs.",
