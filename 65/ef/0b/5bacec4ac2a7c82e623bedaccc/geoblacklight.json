Description The geometry of parcels were created by Carver County's Survey department using COGO in an AutoCad environment. The AutoCad lines have been imported into a ArcGIS Geodatabase and polygons built. These polygons are attributed with a Parcel Identification Number (PID). The GIS polygons are joined by PID to the Assessor's CAMA system and Taxpayer Services tax database to show attributes of the property.",
