Camp Ripley is a military reservation in northern Morrison County in the central part of the state, and Beltrami Island State Forest is in southeastern Roseau County in the northwestern part of the state. Classification was done using multi-temporal interpretation of Landsat TM imagery from 1992-3 and 1996. The classification scheme matches that used for the Landsat_Based Land Cover Inventory produced in 1996 for the forested areas of the state.",
