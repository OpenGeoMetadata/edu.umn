The dataset was clipped and downloaded using the USDA NASS CropScape online web application: http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/ The Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) did minimal processing on this dataset to make more useful for Minnesota-specific work. The lineage section describes these steps taken, but the full description of the Cropland Data Layer can be found in the NASS USDA Metadata.",
