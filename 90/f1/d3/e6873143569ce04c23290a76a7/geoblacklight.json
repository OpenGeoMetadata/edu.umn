It is best suited for desktop applications that require dynamic scaling. It includes cities, counties, and scale-dependent roads. Except at very small scales, it does not include opaque layers like water features. Inside desktop applications, the service does not allow selections and the attribute tables cannot be viewed, but layers can be turned on and off and individual features can be identified.",
