It is a digital version of the Minnesota Geological Survey State Map Series Map S-1 (Geologic Map of Minnesota: Quaternary Geology), 1982, by H.C. Hobbs and J.E. Goebel. (1:500,000). The digital file was created by scanning the 1:500,000-scale paper map and then converting the scanned image into an Arc/INFO polygon coverage. In 2008 MGS converted the original linework to a shapefile format and added more descriptive fields based on the Quaternary Geology Code. File geodatabase format was created for the Minnesota Geospatial Commons.",
