These roads are generally open to the public for recreational use. Some of the segments in this shapefile are components of County administered forest road systems which cross State land. State Forest Roads are classified as either system roads or minimum maintenance roads. System roads are generally well maintained and capable of supporting low-clearance highway licensed vehicles. Minimum maintenance roads are not capable of sustaining routine traffic by highway licensed vehicles. They are posted with signs which state NRoad may be impassable. Travel at your own riskN.",
