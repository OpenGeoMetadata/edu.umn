    "Historical National Boundaries displays global national boundaries for the following dates in history: 1800, 1914, 1918, 1939, 1945, 1970, 1990, 2000. Boundary changes associated with World War I (1914 - 1918) and World War II (1939 - 1945) can be viewed by turning off all other layers and toggling between the two.    Data for each layer comes from a variety of sources, including historical atlases and the Library of Congress website - https://www.loc.gov/maps/."
