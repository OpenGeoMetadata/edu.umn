"dc_description_s": "Energy and water benchmarking results from CY 2012 for public buildings. Includes City, Park Board, Hennepin County and Minneapolis Public Schools. In Minneapolis, large commercial buildings make up almost 50% of the city's energy use. This provides a tremendous opportunity for identifying areas with the largest potential for energy savings. In February of 2013, the Minneapolis City Council adopted ordinance 47.190 requiring commercial buildings 50,000 square feet and over and city-owned buildings 25,000 square feet and over to annually benchmark their energy consumption and report this information to the City. This ordinance will allow building owners and the City to track energy and water usage year to year to determine opportunities for improvement, recognize high performers, and determine progress towards the City's Climate Action Plan goals. This data shows the results of the energy benchmarking conducted by buildings in Minneapolis. Calendar year 2013 and 2014 data include only information on buildings owned by the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, the Minneapolis Public Schools and the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board. More information about the ordinance and the full report on benchmarking results is available here: http://minneapolismn.gov/environment/energy/index.htm",
