Utilizing multi-return systems, LiDAR data in the form of 3-dimensional positions of a dense set of mass points was collected for approximately 1,946 square miles. The vendor delivered the data to the DNR in several formats: 1) One-meter digital elevation model 2) Edge-of-water breaklines 3) Classified LAS formatted point cloud data DNR staff created three additional products: two-foot contours, building outlines and hillshades. The data are in UTM Zone 14 coordinates. Note: This metadata record was created at the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office by combining information supplied by Sanborn and the DNR.",
