"dc_description_s": "Priority Natural Resource Corridors is a subset of the Hennepin County Open Space Corridors feature class. Data set illustrates the general locations of priority natural resource corridors in Hennepin County. Criteria for Priority Corridor: Natural Community Quality - Potential for Rare Species - Good to High Quality Natural Areas Other Unique and/or Ecologically Significant Areas - Moderate to High Quality Natural Areas Large publicly and privately owned and protected open spaces (e.g. Regional Parks, Scientific and Natural Areas, Wildlife Management Areas, Waterfowl Production Areas, The Nature Conservancy, Wildlife Refuges, Conservation Easements) Connectivity - Natural corridors with natural/semi-natural areas that would serve as logical links between Ecologically Significant Areas (e.g. lakes, streams, wetland complexes, drainage ways, floodplains, steep slopes) Data Creation: The data was developed from the analyses of high resolution aerial photography and several GIS datasets, including but not limited to: Ecologically Significant Areas - a subset of the Hennepin County Minnesota Land Cover Classification System National Wetland Inventory Hennepin County Wetland Inventory Public Waters Inventory Regional Parks Permanent Conservation Easements Soils FEMA Floodplains Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Scientific Natural Areas Minnesota Department of Natural Resources County Biological Survey Sites Regional Parks and other protected open spaces U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System, Wildlife Management Areas and Waterfowl Protection Areas Link to Attribute Table Information: http://gis.hennepin.us/OpenData/Metadata/Priority%20Natural%20Resource%20Corridors.pdf Data updated: 2010 Use Limitations: This data (i) is furnished 'AS IS' with no representation as to completeness or accuracy; (ii) is furnished with no warranty of any kind; and (iii) is not suitable for legal, engineering or surveying purposes.
