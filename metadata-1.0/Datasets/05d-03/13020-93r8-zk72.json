Included are R scripts and occurence datasets for running Generalized Boosted Models (GBM) species distribution models for the invasive species Cardamine impatiens, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Humulus japonicus. Also included are R scripts for building spatially explicit species co-occurrence matrices used for running joint species distribution models (specifically gjam models) in for plant communities in Minnesota based on the MN DNR plant releve dataset with a focus on incorporating the invasive species Cardamine impatiens, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Humulus japonicus as well as a case study for the native species Smilacina racemosa. The exact spatial location of each releve has been changed to a gridded position in order to protect the exact location. Raw releve data must be obtained from the MN DNR.|The data includes occurrence records for Cardamine impatiens, Celastrus orbiculatus, Humulus japonicus, and Smilacina racemosa downloaded from EDDMaps on 7 Sept 2020. Also included are spatially explicit species co-occurrence presence/absences matrices for Cardamine impatiens, Celastrus orbiculatus, Humulus japonicus, and Smilacina racemosa.",
