It is the most detailed evaluation to date of access to jobs by walking, and it allows for a direct comparison of the walking accessibility performance of America's largest metropolitan areas. Downloads are available for individual metropolitan regions in CSV or Shapefile format. Combined ZIP files containing the data for all metropolitan regions are also available in CSV and Shapefile format, and are labeled as 'All Metropolitan Regions'.",
