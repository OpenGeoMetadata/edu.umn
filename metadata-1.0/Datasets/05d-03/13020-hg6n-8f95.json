These balloons carry payloads addressing a wide range of scientific questions. We have analyzed these trajectories in order to estimate the expected range of trajectories to aid in mission planning for future balloon experiments from McMurdo.|The data.csv.zip folder consists of 40 trajectory files for long-duration balloon flights launched from McMurdo Station in Antarctica, each containing latitude, longitude, altitude and time since launch. The files in analysis.csv.zip contain data products derived from analysis of the raw data.\n",
