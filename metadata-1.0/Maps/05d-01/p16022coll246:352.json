Anquetil du Perron. The new chorographical map of the Southern counties of India by Col. Kelly, has enabled us to reform in several districts, the geography hitherto adopted for the Southermost part of the peninsula.\"|71 x 53 centimeters|Scale approximately 1:5,650,000|Ames Library of South Asia Maps",
