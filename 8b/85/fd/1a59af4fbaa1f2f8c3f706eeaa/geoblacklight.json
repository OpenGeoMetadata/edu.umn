"dc_description_s": "This layer was created to identify Lakes of Phosphorus Sensitivity Significance (LPSS) within Minnesota. Available lake data were analyzed to classify lakes based on sensitivity to nutrient pollution. Phosphorus sensitivity was estimated for each lake by predicting how much water clarity would be reduced with additional phosphorus loading to the lake. A phosphorus sensitivity significance index was formulated to prioritize lakes as they relate to MPCA's policy objective of focusing on high quality, unimpaired lakes at greatest risk of becoming impaired.The phosphorus sensitivity significance index is a function of phosphorus sensitivity, lake size, lake total phosphorus concentration, proximity to MPCA's phosphorus impairment thresholds, and watershed disturbance. The goal of the LPSS list was to objectively prioritize lakes based on their sensitivity to phosphorus pollution. These results are not appropriate for those lakes listed by MPCA as impaired. Note: Many Minnesota lakes have not been sampled for lake phosphorus; this list will be periodically revised as additional data become available. For a detailed description of criteria and analysis used, see: Lakes of Phosphorus Sensitivity Significance - 08/20/2015 (pdf, 1.8 MB)",
