The dataset is intended to contain a point location and the official address (as defined by the address authority) for all occupiable units and any other official addresses within the jurisdictional boundary of each address authority. A number of other attributes are available in the dataset, but may not be populated by some address authorities. Dakota County is playing a coordinative role to work with cities and townships to create, maintain and aggregate address points.",
