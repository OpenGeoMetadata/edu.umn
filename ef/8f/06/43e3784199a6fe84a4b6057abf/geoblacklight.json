This dataset is composed of one feature class and three standalone tables. - PotentialWaterSupplyIssues = Detailed potential water supply issue polygons - PotentialWaterSupplyIssuesByCTU = Standalone table with summary of potential water supply issues by CTU - PotentialWaterSupplyIssuesByCounty = Standalone table with summary of potential water supply issues by county - PotentialWaterSupplyIssuesByWatershed = Standalone table with summary of potential water supply issues by Watershed Management District or Organization See NAttributesN section of the metadata for a detailed description of each of these water supply issue categories.",
