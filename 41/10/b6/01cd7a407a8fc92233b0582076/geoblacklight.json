Additional modifications were performed by the Hennepin County GIS Office including the following: Retention of the VA Hospital from previous geocoded versions. Break out of the U of M East Bank, West Bank, and Masonic Childrens Hospitals. Break out of the Rochester Mayo campuses. Addition of Health System information supplied by HCMC staff.
