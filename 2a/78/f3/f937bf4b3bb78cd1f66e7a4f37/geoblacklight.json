Companies are issued an Industrial Discharge Permit if they are determined to have a significant impact on the public sewer system. These data also include permitted facilities outside of the seven county service area that hold a permit with MCES. These permits are for wastewater hauled into the service area. More information about the industrial waste program of the Metropolitan Council's Environmental Services Division can be found at http://www.metrocouncil.org/Wastewater-Water/Services/Industrial-Waste.aspx.",
