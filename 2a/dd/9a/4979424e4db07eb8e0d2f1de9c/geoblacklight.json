"dc_description_s": "The National Land Cover Database 2001 for Minnesota was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered NprovisionalN until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004). Three layers are included: - Land Cover (mapping zones 31-51) - Imperviousness Surface (mapping zones 39, 40-42, and 50-51) - Tree Canopy (mapping zones 39-42, 50-51)",
