The littoral depth was derived from a table of maximum vegetation depths as recorded during individual Lake Surveys. 15 Foot Standard: Shows the DNR Fisheries calculated littoral zone based on a standard 15 foot depth contour. All lake areas 0-15 feet in depth are considered to be littoral zone. This definition is based historically on the maximum depth of light penetration to the lake bottom for plant growth (although the actual depth of light penetration varies by lake due to water clarity).",
