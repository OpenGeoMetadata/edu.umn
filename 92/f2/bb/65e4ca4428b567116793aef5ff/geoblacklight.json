"dc_description_s": "The Aggregate Resource Mapping Program (ARMP) began in 1984 when the Minnesota Legislature passed a law (Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94) to: - Identify and classify aggregate resources outside of the Twin Cities metropolitan area; - Give aggregate resource information to local units of government and others for making comprehensive land-use and zoning plans; - Introduce aggregate resource protection; and Promote orderly and environmentally sound development of the resource. Provided here is a compilation of GIS data produced by the DNR's Aggregate Resource Mapping Program. Also provided is the aggregate resource GIS data from the 7-County Metropolitan Area mapped by the Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS). Please see the layer-specific metadata for each of the 9 layers for more details: ARMP: Compilation of Gravel Pits, Quarries, and Prospects Compilation of Crushed Stone Resource Potential Compilation of Geologic Field Observations Compilation of Sand and Gravel Resource Potential Compilation of DNR Test Holes Status Map 7-County Metro Area: Compilation of Pits and Quarries Bedrock Aggregate Sources Sand and Gravel Sources",
