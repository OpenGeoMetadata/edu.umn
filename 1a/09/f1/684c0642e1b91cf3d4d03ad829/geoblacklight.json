"dc_description_s": "Summary The 10 ft contours provide a high level of detail for cartographic representations of the topography within Carver County. The county utilizes the 10 ft contours for purposes of land records management, infrastructure management, engineering pre-design, map production and various land data analysis. Description Fugro Horizons Inc. acquired highly accurate Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) elevation data for the Twin Cities metropolitan region in east-central Minnesota in Spring and Fall 2011, with some reflights in Spring 2012. 1.5 points/square meter covers the Carver County Data. A DEM was created from a terrain using bare-earth multipoint PointZ and hydro-breaklines. The Terrain was then converted to a Raster DEM using a 1-meter cell-size. Two-foot contours were created by resampling the 1-meter DEM to 3 meters, then smoothing the 3-meter grid using a neighborhood average routine, and then creating contours from this surface using standard ArcGIS processing tools. Ten-foot contours were created from the two-foot contour features.",
