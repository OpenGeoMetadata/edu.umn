One shape and one corresponding record exists for each individual transit route. The line work for the dataset was derived from The NCompass Technologies Street Centerline and Address Range dataset. A small number of line segments have been added to those available from the NCompass Technologies dataset to completely depict all routes traveled by fixed-route transit vehicles.",
