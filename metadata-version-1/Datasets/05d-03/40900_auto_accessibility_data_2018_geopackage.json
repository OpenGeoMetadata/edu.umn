This data is part of a longitudinal study. The data available describe access to jobs by auto in the states of Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Tennessee, Washington, and Virginia, and the metropolitan areas within these states.|Downloads are available for individual metropolitan regions, as well as states, in Geopackage format.
