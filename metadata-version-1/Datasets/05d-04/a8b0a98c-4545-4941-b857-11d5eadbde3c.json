The information collected during the project is used to develop maps, data-base files, and reports. This same information is also produced as digital files for use with computers. The map information is formatted as geographic information system (GIS) files with associated data bases. The maps and reports are also reproduced as portable document files (PDFs) that can be opened on virtually any computer using the free Acrobat Reader from Adobe.com.; The Meeker County board of Commissioners and the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund as recommended by the Legislative - Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources",
