  "dc_description_s": "This data was created as part of a study that examined the accessibility to jobs by biking in the 50 largest (by population) metropolitan areas in the United States, on low-stress and higher-stress streets via a Level of Traffic Stress analysis process. It is the most detailed evaluation to date of access to jobs by bike nationally, and it allows for a direct comparison of the bicycle accessibility performance of America's largest metropolitan areas. This data are part of a longitudinal study.|Downloads are available for individual metropolitan regions, as well as states, in Geopackage format. Each individual ZIP file for a metropolitan area or state contains four ZIP-compressed Geopackage files of accessibility data, one for each of the four Level of Traffic Stress levels 1-4. A combined ZIP file containing the data for all metropolitan regions is also available in Geopackage format, and is labeled as \"All Metropolitan Regions.\"",
