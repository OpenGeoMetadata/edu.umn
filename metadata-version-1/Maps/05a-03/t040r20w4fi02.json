Because the correction line, which also served as a township exterior, was run before the other township exteriors and because the exteriors were run south to north, the most northerly sections of the township, section 1-6, are considerably smaller than the other section. The diagram, certified as a true copy of the original on June 2, 1860, ���������������������������showing the fractional parts of section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, & 6, numbered in accordance with the letter of instructions furnished by the letter from the Commissioner��������������������������� of May 19, 1860 was made to show the amendments the Commissioner wanted the Surveyor General to make to the original approved plat.",
