A sewershed is a defined area that is tributary to a single point along an MCES interceptor pipe (a community connection to an interceptor) or is tributary to a single lift station. Community boundaries are also used to define sewer-shed boundaries. The data are derived from community comprehensive sewer plans. Notes: - The sewersheds are estimated. The actual sewersheds may be different. - Not all records contain county or MCD information.",
