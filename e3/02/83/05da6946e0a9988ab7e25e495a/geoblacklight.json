The tables are a select subset of population data from the Census Bureau's P-94-171 redistricting data. These tables can be linked to census block, block group and tract boundary files. Notes: - When linking population tables to the corresponding shape file, be aware that there are 3 block groups in the block group shape file that have 2 polygons each and 1 tract in the tract shape file that has 2 polygons. This impacts population summaries. Bg00: 270030509012, 270530253011, 271230426023 Tract00: 27003050901",
