TOD allows applicants to request resources from the following sources in one application: - Tax Base Revitalization Account (TBRA) Contamination Cleanup Site Investigation TOD grants - helps applicants (1) determine the scope/severity of suspected contamination and (2) develop a clean up plan for environmental remediation of a site they have or will purchase. - TBRA Contamination Cleanup TOD grants - helps applicants who have recently completed their site investigation implement their cleanup plan and begin redeveloping their site. - Livable Communities Demonstration Account (LCDA) Pre-Development TOD grants - helps applicants define their projects by funding activities such as design workshops, redevelopment preparation, corridor or station area planning, development of zoning and land use tools, and strategizing for land banking and acquisition. - LCDA Development TOD grants - help applicants acquire or prepare sites, begin (re)development, and/or build infrastructure",
