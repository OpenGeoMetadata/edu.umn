When specific site details were available, the geography was moved off the street lines to the actual lot locations using 2005 Markhurd orthophotography as a base layer. All attempts were made to correctly reflect the real lot locations; however, the positional accuracy of this data cannot be guaranteed. Attribute information is considered current to the metadata date and will be updated as needed.",
