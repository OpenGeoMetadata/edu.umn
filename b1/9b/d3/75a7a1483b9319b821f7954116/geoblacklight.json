"dc_description_s": "The Metropolitan Council Transporation Policy plan defines a transit center as: A transit stop or station at the meeting point of several routes or lines or of different modes of transportation. It is located on or off the street and is designed to handle the movement of transit units (vehicles or trains) and the boarding, alighting, and transferring of passengers between routes or lines (in which case it is also known as a transfer center) or different modes (also known as a modal interchange center, intermodal transfer facility or an hub). The TransitCenters dataset includes all ACTIVE and INACTIVE locations identified by Metropolitan Council's Transportation Policy Plan, mapped on the Regional System Map, identified in a memo, NTD reporting or included in facilities managment. Field attributes include sources where these facilities were identified as Transit Centers. Some locations have additional facilities such as shelters, park and rides and rail stations. In many cases these are places where: 1. Two or more routes connect to transfer passengers 2. Buses connect off street, or in clearly designated on-street spaces 3. There are multiple marked 'gates' for different routes and directions 4. The location serves a major activity center, such as a shopping center. 5. There is a standing facility or, in some cases, a collection of bus shelters",
