"dc_description_s": "This spreadsheet includes Minnesota sales tax information for the years 2003-2009. Data includes total amount of sales tax collected (state, county, city, and special purpose levies) and the number of businesses in the geographic area. Data are unduplicated and reported in one of four general categories: 1. Records outside of Minnesota are reported at the state level and include territories, APO's, foreign and unassigned. Within Minnesota, records are assigned to one of three geographic levels (blockgroup, city or county): 2. Within the 7-county Twin Cities metro area, records are assigned to blockgroups. 3. Outside of the 7-county Twin Cities metro area, records are assigned to cities with populations greater than 2,000 residents. 4. All other unassigned Minnesota records are tabulated by county. For additional information and statistical reports, please visit http://www.revenue.state.mn.us/research_stats/Pages/Whats-New.aspx Note: The positional accuracy of many locations for years 2003-08 has been improved in this version, therefore, anyone using this data should download and replace any previous version.",
