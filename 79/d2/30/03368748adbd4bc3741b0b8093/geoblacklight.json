This estimate represents the total number of heavy commercial vehicles per year divided by 365 and is developed using factors to adjust for season on sampled road systems in a particular given year. This information is displayed using the road centerlines within the state. This centerline layer is a subset of the State of Minnesota BaseMap which consists of a number of individual data layers originally digitized from USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles, but later updated via aerial imagery and local input.",
