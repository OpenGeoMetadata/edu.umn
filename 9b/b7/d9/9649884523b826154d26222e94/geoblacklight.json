Access to computers and the Internet, along with the skills to use these tools is critical as technology becomes more and more a part of our daily lives and is integrated in our economic, educational, health, and workforce systems. The results will inform priorities for the City\u2019s digital inclusion initiatives, and help engage businesses, neighborhood and community groups, public sector partners, and funders to more effectively address community technology and economic development needs. In addition, the survey provides data to measure changes in the community over time. The City of Minneapolis Information Technology Department contracted with National Research Center, Inc. (NRC) to conduct a survey of residents to inform the City\u2019s efforts to overcome the digital equity gap between individuals and groups in their access to and use and knowledge of information and communication technologies.
