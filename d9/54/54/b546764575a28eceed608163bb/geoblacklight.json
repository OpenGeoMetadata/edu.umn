The Hi- Transit stops served by Hi-Frequency routes are marked with red signs. The line work for the dataset was derived from the NCompass Technologies Street Centerline and Address Ranges dataset. A small number of line segments have been added to those available from the NCompass dataset to completely depict all routes traveled by buses.",
