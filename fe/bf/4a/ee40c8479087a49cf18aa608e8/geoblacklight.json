These forecasts are for the old TAZ system with 1,568 zones. Note:forecasts for the new official TAZ system with 3,030 zones are available in theTransportation Analysis Zones (Official TAZ System w/3,030 Zones) with Current Forecasts shapefile. IMPORTANT NOTES: These TAZ forecasts will change multiple times over the next few years. The Metropolitan Council will ask cities and townships to allocate their TAZ forecasts as part of their 2018 Comprehensive Plan Update (go to http://www.metrocouncil.org/Handbook/Plan-Elements/Transportation.aspx for more information about this process). Communities may also revise their current TAZ forecasts before the 2018 Comprehensive Plan Update. In the meantime, the Council provides these Current TAZ forecasts for transportation planning. If you are using TAZ forecasts for analysis and/or transportation planning, please download the latest version of this shapefile to ensure you are using the most up-to-date data. If you represent a community that wants to revise your TAZ forecasts, please contact your community's sector representative or Dennis Farmer (see contact information at the end of this document).",
